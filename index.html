		    	My name is Babette and I am proud to call myself a web developer student in training! I love to lose track of time when working on developing my new skills in the web development world.     		
		    	When I am not studying I am always looking for new adventures. I absolutely love to travel and meet new people, to have conversations about what our purpose can be, living on this beautiful planet, sharing stories and love hard! I want to live a simple life surrounded with kind and loving people and in a beautiful environment.

			<p> 
				One of my first made web-page with Skillcrush. This was the moment for me where I thought: 'I really want to get more skills to make my website look awesome!'. I am so happy I've started this course with Skillcrush. The Jubilee project is a personal story about someone who, just like me, once upon a time started her journet in the super exciting web development world. I have to say that it's always nice to hear similar stories. Stories that make you feel not so lonely I guess. Everyone started somewhere at some point, and worked hard to get where they want to be. That is exactly what I am going to do! Let me rephrase that: what I AM doing!
